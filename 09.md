# What is the difference between process.nextTick() and setTimeout()? create a table in md

| Feature                  | `process.nextTick()`                                  | `setTimeout()`                                   |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Execution Timing         | Executes **after current operation** but **before** any I/O events or timers | Executes **after at least the specified delay** and **after I/O events** |
| Use Case                 | Deferring execution until the next event loop phase (microtask queue) | Scheduling tasks after a delay (macrotask queue) |
| Delay Parameter          | No delay parameter; executes ASAP after current phase | Accepts delay in milliseconds (default is 0)     |
| Callback Queue           | **Microtask queue**                                   | **Macrotask (timer) queue**                      |
| Priority                 | Higher (runs before timers and I/O callbacks)         | Lower (runs after microtasks and I/O callbacks)  |
| Blocking Behavior        | Can starve the event loop if abused (infinite recursion) | Less likely to block the event loop             |
| Typical Use              | Cleanup, error handling, async control flow helpers   | Delayed execution, polling, timeouts             |
