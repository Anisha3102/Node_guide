# How does Node.js handle asynchronous operations?

## Answer:
- Node.js handles asynchronous operations using a single-threaded event loop and a non-blocking I/O model. While JavaScript runs on a single thread, Node delegates heavy I/O operations—like file access or network calls—to background threads provided by the libuv library. Once these operations complete, their callbacks are added to a queue. The event loop continuously checks this queue and executes the callbacks when the main thread is idle. This allows Node.js to handle many concurrent operations efficiently without blocking the thread.

## Optional Addition 
"Node.js supports multiple async patterns, including callbacks, Promises, and async/await. While callbacks were traditionally used, Promises and async/await are now preferred for better readability and error handling. Under the hood, though, they all rely on the same event loop mechanism."

## How It Works (High-Level Overview)
### Single-threaded Event Loop
Node.js runs on a single thread, but it uses the event loop to manage asynchronous tasks efficiently without blocking that thread.

### Delegation to Worker Threads (via libuv)
For expensive I/O operations (like file system or network requests), Node.js delegates the work to libuv, which uses a thread pool in the background. Once the operation finishes, the result is added to the event queue.

 ### Event Loop + Callback Execution
The event loop continuously checks the queue. When the main thread is idle, it picks up tasks from the queue and executes their associated callbacks.
