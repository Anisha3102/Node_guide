# What is Node.js and why is it used?


- Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside the browser, typically on the server side.

# What Is Node.js?
- Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine (the same engine that powers Google Chrome).

- Uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient.

# Why Is Node.js Used?

## Server-Side JavaScript
- Node.js lets us use JavaScript on the back end, enabling full-stack development with a single language (JavaScript) on both client and server sides.

## Non-Blocking I/O (Asynchronous)
- Ideal for handling multiple requests concurrentlyâ€”great for real-time applications like chat apps, live updates, and APIs.

## Fast Performance
- Thanks to the V8 engine and its asynchronous nature, Node.js is very fast for I/O-heavy tasks like reading/writing files, making API calls, or handling network traffic.

## NPM (Node Package Manager)
- Comes with a vast ecosystem of open-source libraries (modules) via NPM, making development faster and easier.

## Scalability
- Node.js is built to handle many simultaneous connections efficiently, which makes it suitable for scalable network applications.

## Community Support
- A large, active community ensures continuous improvements, a wide range of tutorials, and libraries for almost any task.

# Common Use Cases
- REST APIs / GraphQL APIs

- Real-time applications (chat apps, live feeds)

- Single Page Applications (SPAs)

- IoT backend systems

- Streaming services
