# What is npm? How do you use it?

## What is npm?
- npm stands for Node Package Manager. It is the default package manager for Node.js, and it's used to:

- Install packages (libraries/tools) from the npm registry.

- Manage dependencies for our project.

- Run scripts defined in our project (test, start, build, etc.).

- Publish our own packages to the npm registry.

## How Do You Use npm?
### 1. Initialize a Node.js project
- Creates a package.json file to track dependencies and metadata.

```bash
npm init
# or use defaults:
npm init -y
```

### 2. Install Packages
- Locally (recommended â€” stored in node_modules of your project):

```bash
npm install express
Globally (available system-wide):
```
```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```
### 3. Install Dev Dependencies
- Packages used only during development (e.g., testing tools, linters):

```bash
npm install eslint --save-dev
```
### 4. Run Scripts
- Define scripts in package.json like:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js",
  "dev": "nodemon index.js"
}
```
- Then run:

```bash
npm start
npm run dev
```

### 5. List Installed Packages
```bash
npm list
npm list --depth=0    # Only top-level packages
```

### 6. Uninstall a Package
```bash
npm uninstall express
```

### 7. Update Packages
```bash
npm update
```
