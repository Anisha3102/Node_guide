# Explain the event-driven architecture of Node.js.

## Event-Driven Architecture in Node.js — Explained
- Node.js uses an event-driven architecture, which is a key reason for its high performance and scalability, especially in handling I/O-bound operations.

## What Does “Event-Driven” Mean?
- In an event-driven system:

- The flow of the program is determined by events (like incoming requests, file reads, etc.).

- Instead of blocking (waiting) for operations to finish, Node.js registers callbacks and moves on.

- When the operation completes, an event is emitted, and the registered callback is invoked.

## Node.js Event Loop — Core Component
- The event loop is the engine that drives the event-driven architecture.

## Here's how it works:
- Starts with a single thread (main thread).

- Listens for events (e.g., I/O, timers, HTTP requests).

- Uses callback functions to handle events asynchronously.

- Maintains a queue (task queue + microtask queue).

- Continuously processes events in phases (timers, I/O callbacks, etc.).

## Example
```js
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('File content:', data); // This runs later
});

console.log('Reading file...'); // This runs first
```

## Output:
```arduino
Reading file...
File content: Hello World!
```

### Why? Because fs.readFile is non-blocking — the callback is queued and executed when the file is ready.

## EventEmitter in Node.js
- Node.js provides the EventEmitter class to implement custom event-driven logic.

```js
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter();

emitter.on('greet', () => {
  console.log('Hello from EventEmitter!');
});

emitter.emit('greet');
```

## Benefits of Event-Driven Architecture in Node.js

| Benefit              | Description                                               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **High Concurrency** | Handles many connections without creating new threads     |
| **Non-blocking I/O** | Efficient use of system resources                         |
| **Real-Time Ready**  | Ideal for apps like chat, gaming, notifications           |
| **Simplified Code Flow** | Events + callbacks or promises instead of threading |
