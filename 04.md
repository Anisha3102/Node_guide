## What is a Callback Function in Node.js?
- In Node.js, a callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of that functionâ€”often used for handling asynchronous operations like file I/O, database queries, or network requests.

## Example: Reading a File with a Callback
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', function(err, data) {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Error reading file:", err);
    return;
  }
  console.log("File contents:", data);
});
```
## Explanation:
- fs.readFile is an asynchronous function from Node's fs (file system) module.

### It takes 3 arguments:

- File name ('example.txt')

- Encoding ('utf8')

- A callback function that is called when reading is complete.

### The callback function receives:

- err: an error object (if an error occurred),

- data: the contents of the file (if successful).

## Why Use Callbacks in Node.js?
- Node.js is designed to be non-blocking and asynchronous, so instead of waiting for operations to finish, it uses callbacks to handle the result when it's ready.
