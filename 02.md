| Feature                    | Synchronous Code                                 | Asynchronous Code                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Execution**             | Executes **line by line**, waits for each task    | Doesn't wait â€” tasks run in the background        |
| **Blocking**              | **Blocks** further execution until task completes | **Non-blocking**, continues to next task          |
| **Performance**           | Slower for I/O-heavy tasks                        | Faster and more efficient for I/O operations      |
| **Use Case**              | Suitable for simple, sequential tasks             | Ideal for API calls, file I/O, DB queries, etc.   |
| **Example**               | Reading a file and waiting for it to finish       | Reading a file while the app continues running    |
| **Error Handling**        | Uses try-catch                                    | Uses callbacks, promises, or async/await          |
| **Example Code**          | `let data = fs.readFileSync('file.txt')`          | `fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => {...})`   |
