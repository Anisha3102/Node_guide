# What is Node.js? How is it different from traditional web servers?

## What is Node.js?
- Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser — primarily on the server side.

- Built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

- Enables building scalable network applications.

- Uses a non-blocking, event-driven architecture.

## Node.js vs Traditional Web Servers (like Apache, IIS)

| Feature                  | Node.js                                              | Traditional Web Servers                              |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Architecture**         | Event-driven, non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O        | Thread-based, blocking (synchronous) I/O              |
| **Concurrency Model**    | Single-threaded with event loop                      | Multi-threaded — each request handled in a new thread |
| **Language**             | JavaScript                                           | Configuration + server-side languages (PHP, Java, etc.) |
| **Use Case**             | Real-time apps, APIs, microservices, streaming       | Static sites, dynamic pages using server-side rendering |
| **Performance**          | High for I/O-heavy tasks                             | May slow under high concurrency due to thread overhead |
| **Scalability**          | Highly scalable due to non-blocking I/O              | Less scalable under many simultaneous connections     |
| **Built-in Server?**     | Yes (via `http` module)                              | No — requires setup (e.g., Apache + PHP)              |
| **Community and Ecosystem** | npm (largest ecosystem of JS packages)            | Strong, but more fragmented per language              |


## Example
### Node.js Server Example:

```js
const http = require('http');

http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.write('Hello from Node.js!');
  res.end();
}).listen(3000);
```
## When to Use Node.js
- Real-time applications (chat, games)

- APIs and microservices

- Streaming platforms

- Event-driven apps
